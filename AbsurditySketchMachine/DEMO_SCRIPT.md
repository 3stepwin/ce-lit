# CE-LIT DEMO SCRIPT // 30 SECOND PITCH
**Status:** LIVE
**Version:** 4.0.1 (Institutional Reality)

---

### [0:00] THE OPENER (Screen 1: System Threshold)

*(Hold phone up. Screen shows the 3 Vector Buttons: LIFE, WORK, SIGNAL)*

**YOU:** "Most AI apps ask you to type a prompt. They ask you to do the work."
**YOU:** "CE-LIT is different. We don't want your creativity. We want your compliance."

*(Tap **WORK** button)*

**YOU:** "I select a Reality Vector. Let's say... Work. The system now owns my context."

---

### [0:10] THE ASSEMBLY (Screen 2: Generating)

*(Screen shows scrolling terminal logs: "EXTRACTING SEED...", "VECTOR_LOCK: VERIFIED")*

**YOU:** "Notice I'm not typing. I'm not waiting for a spinner. I'm watching the **Multi-Agent System** work in parallel."
**YOU:** "Agent A (The Keeper) locks the Reality Vector. Agent B (The Architect) constructs the prompt from our Seed Bank."
**YOU:** "Agent C (The Novita Engine) renders the artifact asynchronously. You see their handshake right here in the logs."
**YOU:** "It's not just a loading screen. It's evidence of the system conspiring to fulfill your request."

### [0:25] THE REVEAL (Screen 3: Final State)

*(App vibrates. Video loops. It’s high-quality, deadpan, institutional.)*
*(Punchline box appears: **"YOU ARE INCLUDED."**)*

**YOU:** "And there it is. The 'Institutional Artifact'."
**YOU:** "It looks real. It feels official. And it delivers a verdict."

*(Scroll horizontally on Outtakes)*

**YOU:** "Here are the rejected outcomes. Deleted scenes. Just enough context to make you want to prove you were there."

*(Point to SHARE PROOF button)*

**YOU:** "I don't share this because it's funny. I share it effectively to warn others. That is the viral engine."

### [0:30] CLOSING

**YOU:** "Reface put you in a movie. CE-LIT puts you in a subpoena. That's the upgrade."
