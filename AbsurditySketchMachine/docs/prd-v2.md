# PRD: CELIT Viral System v2.0 "ALL OUT +"

## 1. Executive Summary
CELIT v2.0 is a psychological mirror engine that generates highly shareable "Artifacts" alongside premium video trailers. It prioritizes "Retention Density" and "Share-Or-Die" mechanics to ensure viral success with zero user friction.

## 2. Problem Statement
Users want to be viral but don't want to do the creative work. Existing AI video feels "fake" and "generic". CELIT v2.0 solves this by leaning into "Institutional Absurdity" and "Deadpan Bureaucracy".

## 3. The Viral Trinity
Every generation must produce:
1. **Main Trailer Sketch (20–60s)**: High-production trailer that flips into absurdity.
2. **Meme Freeze Frame**: High-contrast, legible "Proof Artifact" that works as a standalone post.
3. **Outtakes (2-3 variants)**: Low-fidelity variations for algorithm ammo.

## 4. Retention Density Engine
- Visual event every 2-3 seconds.
- Loop-phrasing (end feeds the start).
- Silence before the Pattern Interrupt.
- Hard cut endings (no fades).

## 5. Compliance & Safety
- AI Generated tags mandatory.
- Public figure blocking.
- Refusal of negative targeting.
