# Product Brief: Absurdity AI Sketch Machine (v3.0 Upgrade)

## 1. Project Overview
The **Absurdity AI Sketch Machine** (Cult Engine) is a viral video generation platform leveraging the EMDADF-BMAD Fusion Ultimate v3.0 framework. It automates the creation of high-retention, "absurd" aesthetic video content for social media (TikTok, Reels, Shorts).

**Current State:** v2.0 "ALL OUT +" prototype exists.
**Goal:** Upgrade to v3.0 "Full Build" standard, creating a complete, scalable, self-contained application ecosystem.

## 2. Key Objectives (v3.0)
- **Framework Compliance:** Fully implement EMDADF v3.0 phases (Strategy, Arch, UX, Planning, Stories, Dev, QA, Deploy).
- **Scale:** Move from ~10 stories to 50+ detailed user stories.
- **Depth:** detailed SQL schema (with RLS), comprehensive API contracts, and a 12-15 screen UX flow.
- **Viral Trinity:** Refine the "Main Trailer", "Meme Artifact", and "Outtaken" content loop.

## 3. Market & User Analysis
- **Target User:** Content Creators, Brands, and "Cult Leaders" seeking viral reach without creative burnout.
- **Pain Point:** "Content Treadmill" - high effort, low hit rate, generic AI output.
- **Solution:** "Institutional Absurdity" - a tool that generates uniquely weird, high-retention content automatically.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- **Stack:** Expo SDK 52 + React Native, Supabase, Next.js (Admin), Gemini/Claude AI.
- **Mobile First:** Primary interaction is via mobile app.

## 5. Success Metrics
- **Time to Viral:** Users generate shareable content in < 60s.
- **Retention:** Videos achieve >80% retention rate (simulated or real).
- **Architecture:** Zero "magic strings", full type safety, robust RLS.
